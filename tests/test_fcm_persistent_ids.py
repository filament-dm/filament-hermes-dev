"""Tests for received-persistent-id persistence and redelivery dedup.

These guard against the /restart redelivery loop: Google MCS re-pushes any
message whose ack never flushed, so ids must survive a gateway restart
(seeding the next MCS login) and redeliveries must be dropped before
dispatch.

``credentials.py`` is pure-stdlib, so we load it standalone — importing the
package triggers ``__init__`` → the Hermes ``gateway`` package, which isn't
present in a bare test environment.
