"""Tests for the directory-plugin entry point and its vendored dependencies.

`hermes plugins install <repo> --enable` clones this repo and nothing else — no
pip, no uv, no plugin code executed. Everything that makes the installed tree a
working plugin therefore has to be *in the repo*, and these tests pin the parts
that are easy to break without noticing:

* the root ``__init__.py`` exists, exposes ``register``, and imports with only
  the standard library available;
* ``vendor/`` carries every dependency that is supposed to be vendored, at a
  version satisfying pyproject's constraint;
* ``vendor/`` stays pure Python, so the one committed tree works everywhere.

Loaded standalone (no Hermes, no firebase) like the other tests here.
