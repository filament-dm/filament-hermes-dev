"""@everyone/@here must never count as a mention of the agent.

The wake predicate is a pure function (``reactive.is_agent_mention``) so this
invariant is pinned by tests rather than living in an inline expression a
merge conflict can silently rewrite — which is how it was lost once. The
source-level test is the backstop: it fails if anyone reintroduces the old
inline ``or msg.is_everyone_mention`` in the adapter instead of going through
the predicate.
