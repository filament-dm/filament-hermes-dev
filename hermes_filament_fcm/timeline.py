"""Compact timeline rendering for message-tool results.

Hermes keeps every tool result in session history for the life of the
session — nothing is evicted. A ``get_recent_messages`` result rendered as
pretty-printed JSON costs ~300–400 tokens per message, most of it envelope
metadata the model reads once at most, and the cost is paid again on every
overlapping fetch in every session that looks. Rendered as one
provenance-labeled line per message (~25–40 tokens), the same conversation
persists in history at roughly the rate it actually grew.

The renderers are lossy about METADATA only, never content: the full body
text, the event id (needed to target ``reply_in_thread``/``react``), the
sender with their classification, the time, and media/reaction/quote
annotations all survive. An unexpected payload shape raises, and the tool
handler falls back to the JSON form — compact rendering must never hide
data behind a parse bug.

Trust posture: the timeline is data-plane content. ``OBSERVED_NOTE`` labels
every rendering as observed data, mirroring the envelope's event-data
framing — rendering compactly must not make channel text read more like
instructions than the JSON form did. Renderer-attached framing (ids,
sender classification, media/reaction annotations) is wrapped in ``⟨⟩``,
and ``_clean`` strips those characters from all untrusted text, so the
framing grammar cannot be forged by message content; the JSON form
relies on quoting for the same guarantee.

Stdlib-only and side-effect-free, standalone-loadable like ``slash.py``.
