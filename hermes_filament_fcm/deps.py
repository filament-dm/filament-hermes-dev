"""Runtime dependency check (stdlib-only, unit-testable).

This plugin is installed as a *directory plugin* (git-cloned into
``~/.hermes/plugins/``) and carries its Python dependencies in its own
``vendor/`` tree, which the root ``__init__.py`` puts on ``sys.path``. So
``hermes plugins update`` — a git pull of the plugin tree — refreshes code and
dependencies together, and there is no separate dependency step to forget.

What can still go wrong is an environment mismatch: an ambient copy of a
dependency outranks the vendored one (deliberately — see the root
``__init__.py``), and it may be older than this release needs. The vendored tree
can also be missing outright, from a partial clone or a hand-assembled plugin
directory.

``dep_problem()`` makes either case legible: it verifies ``firebase-messaging``
is importable and within the required version range, and returns a
human-readable remediation string when it isn't (or ``None`` when all is well).
The plugin wires this into ``check_requirements`` so a stale/missing dep
surfaces as an actionable message instead of a raw ``ImportError`` at gateway
start.

Importing ``firebase_messaging`` here also pulls its compiled stack
(aiohttp / cryptography / protobuf), so a single guarded import covers the
whole dependency set — if any piece is missing, the import fails and we report
it, rather than crashing later.

Keep this stdlib-only (no ``packaging``) so it works on the same interpreters
as ``_version`` and never adds a dependency of its own.
