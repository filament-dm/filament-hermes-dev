"""Reactive-mode plumbing for the Filament FCM adapter.

Shared channels (everything except the principal's backchannel) run in
"reactive mode": an inbound event is a wake-up signal, not a command. The
adapter wakes the agent according to a tunable WAKE POLICY, and the agent acts
on the event data according to tunable STANDING INSTRUCTIONS — never treating the data
itself as instructions.

Both the standing instructions and the wake policy are *data the adapter reads
fresh on every event* (not startup config), so the principal can retune them
from the backchannel with the ``set_instructions`` / ``set_wake_policy`` tools,
and the next event uses the new value — no restart. ``current_zone`` is the
per-turn gate that keeps those tools control-plane-only.

    Precedence for the editable layer (``read``): the principal's file (written
    by ``set_instructions``) wins; if it's absent or empty, fall back to the
    bundled ``default_instructions.md`` (a safe generic starter: greet back,
    escalate other requests to the principal); if even that is unreadable, a
    hard-coded observe-silently string.

    ``read_effective`` composes the safety-critical ``CORE_RULES`` on top of that
    editable layer. The adapter frames a turn with ``read_effective`` so the core
    rules always apply, while ``get_instructions`` / ``set_instructions`` operate
    on the editable layer alone — the principal customizes behavior, not the

    A bundle value is a list of entries; each entry is a tool name or
    ``"@other_bundle"`` to include another bundle (built-in or custom). Custom
    bundles override built-ins of the same name, which is how the principal
    tweaks a starter bundle ("modified bundles"). A grant (or @include) may
    also name the reserved ``mcp:<server>`` auto-bundle, which expands to the
    live tools of Hermes toolset ``mcp-<server>`` via the ``toolset_tools``
    lookup the caller injects (nothing without one — fail closed).

    Resolution is channel-scoped and fail-closed: a data turn's allowed tools
    are the channel's ``per_channel`` entry if one is present, else
    ``default_capabilities``, expanded to tool names. The channel entry
    REPLACES the default (override, not union) — the invariant is that a
    listed channel resolves to exactly its own grant list, so a channel can be
    narrowed below the default (down to an empty grant) as well as widened.
    An unlisted channel gets exactly ``default_capabilities`` (a minimal
    profile), never full access. ``UNGATEABLE`` is then unioned into
    every resolved set — turn hygiene no grant vocabulary can remove.

    ``per_user`` is deferred: it stays in the document schema and
    ``set_capabilities`` still accepts and stores it, but ``resolve`` ignores
    it entirely — a sender's personal grant never changes what a turn may
    call.

    Designed to migrate to a server-hosted policy later: replace ``read`` with
    an HTTP fetch returning the same shape and nothing else changes.
