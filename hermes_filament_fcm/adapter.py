"""FCM-based Filament platform adapter for Hermes.

Receives messages via Firebase Cloud Messaging push notifications.
Sends responses via Filament MCP tools over HTTP.

The agent never speaks a chat protocol directly — it sees structured push
payloads and interacts through a controlled API surface.

Requires a pre-generated MCP token (FILAMENT_MCP_TOKEN). See README.md
for how to generate one using the RFC 8693 token exchange endpoint.

Startup is staged:
  1. initialize_api  — connect to Filament MCP endpoint with the provided token
  2. register_fcm    — FCM checkin + registration → FCM token
  3. register_pusher — register FCM token with the Filament server (via MCP tool)
  4. start_listener  — open persistent MCS connection for push reception
