"""Setup CLI for hermes-filament-fcm.

Handles the chicken-and-egg problem where `hermes gateway setup` can't
see the plugin until it's in `plugins.enabled`, but the setup wizard is
supposed to handle enabling it.

This script:
  1. Adds 'filament-fcm' to plugins.enabled in config.yaml
  2. Runs the interactive setup (prompts for token, senders, URL)
  3. Restarts the gateway

Usage:
