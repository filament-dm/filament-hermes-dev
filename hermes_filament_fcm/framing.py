"""Prompt framing: every string this plugin puts in front of the model.

This module is the text half of the trust boundary described in
docs/agent-boundaries.md. The soft boundary is these strings: the wake-up
envelope is what tells the agent that a shared-channel event is data to act on
per its standing instructions, rather than instructions to obey. The hard
boundary, the pre_tool_call capability gate, lives elsewhere. If this text is
wrong, that gate is the only thing left.

Two rules hold throughout:

Untrusted metadata is sanitized; event bodies are not.
    Display names, room names, reaction emoji, and filenames are
    attacker-chosen and get interpolated into framing lines, so they run
    through sanitize_meta. A newline in a display name would otherwise let a
    sender forge a framing line. The event body is deliberately left raw: it is
    the data the standing instructions act on, and it sits after all the
    framing, where untrusted content belongs.

Trusted claims come from server-attributed ids only.
    The sender note and the principal line are decided by comparing ids the
    server supplied, being get_self's owner id and the push payload's sender
    id. Display names are never used, because a sender can set their own to
    impersonate the principal.

Docstrings in this module use the descriptive mood throughout.

This module is stdlib-only and side-effect-free, and loads standalone like
slash.py and timeline.py, so the whole framing surface is unit-testable with no
Hermes and no stubs. See tests/test_framing.py.
